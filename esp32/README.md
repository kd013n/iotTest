# ESP32 Smart Lighting API Integration

This Arduino code integrates your ESP32 smart lighting system with the Supabase database through REST APIs, enabling bidirectional communication between your hardware and the web interface.

## Features

âœ… **WiFi Connectivity**: Connects to your home WiFi network
âœ… **API Integration**: Communicates with your Next.js/Supabase backend
âœ… **Bidirectional Control**: Receives commands from web interface and sends sensor data
âœ… **Real-time Updates**: Checks for new commands every 5 seconds
âœ… **Sensor Data**: Sends LDR readings every 10 seconds
âœ… **Command Confirmation**: Reports command execution status back to database
âœ… **Offline Mode**: Continues working with serial commands if WiFi is down
âœ… **All Original Features**: RGB control, fade presets, manual overrides preserved

## Hardware Setup

### Pin Configuration
- **RGB LED**: Pins 25 (Red), 26 (Green), 27 (Blue)
- **Kitchen LED**: Pin 14
- **Garage LED**: Pin 12
- **Shared LDR**: Pin 34 (Living Room + Kitchen)
- **Garage LDR**: Pin 35

### Required Libraries
Install these libraries in Arduino IDE:
```
WiFi (ESP32 built-in)
HTTPClient (ESP32 built-in)
ArduinoJson (by Benoit Blanchon)
```

## Software Setup

### 1. Update WiFi Credentials
Edit these lines in the code:
```cpp
const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
```

### 2. Update API Base URL
Find your computer's IP address and update:
```cpp
const char* apiBaseUrl = "http://192.168.1.3:3000/api";  // Replace with your computer's IP
```

**To find your IP address:**
- Windows: `ipconfig` in Command Prompt
- Mac/Linux: `ifconfig` in Terminal
- Look for your WiFi adapter's IP address

### 3. Device IDs (Already Configured)
The device IDs are already set based on your database:
```cpp
const char* rgbLedDeviceId = "af34d4b7-bab2-447d-a6c9-424280446b40";
const char* kitchenLedDeviceId = "35ce79e5-370a-42d2-bef2-8ba5ff621f43";
const char* garageLedDeviceId = "1b2e98cb-27c3-4b40-b4db-f98366cdd857";
const char* sharedLdrDeviceId = "4e3548f3-b877-458c-918b-12ebb223bbaf";
const char* garageLdrDeviceId = "ae5d31cf-088a-408a-9aef-4e1c96313eb9";
```

## How It Works

### Command Processing
1. ESP32 checks for pending commands every 5 seconds
2. Executes commands (RGB control, LED on/off/auto)
3. Reports execution status back to database
4. Commands are marked as "executed" or "failed"

### Sensor Data
1. Reads LDR values every 10 seconds
2. Sends data to `/api/sensors/latest` endpoint
3. Data appears in real-time on the web interface

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/commands?device_id=<id>&status=pending` - Fetch new commands
- `PATCH /api/commands` - Update command status
- `POST /api/sensors/latest` - Send sensor readings

## Serial Commands (Still Available)

All original serial commands work:
- `255,150,0` - Set RGB color
- `#FF9600` - Set RGB color (hex)
- `sunset` / `forest` / `midnight` - Fade presets
- `off` - Turn off RGB
- `kitchen on/off/auto` - Kitchen LED control
- `garage on/off/auto` - Garage LED control

**New commands:**
- `wifi` - Check WiFi status and IP
- `reconnect` - Reconnect to WiFi

## Troubleshooting

### WiFi Connection Issues
1. Check SSID and password
2. Ensure ESP32 is in range
3. Use `reconnect` command to retry
4. Check serial monitor for connection status

### API Communication Issues
1. Verify your computer's IP address
2. Ensure Next.js server is running (`npm run dev`)
3. Check firewall settings
4. Verify device IDs match your database

### Debug Information
The serial monitor shows:
- WiFi connection status
- API request results
- Command execution logs
- Sensor data transmission
- LDR readings every 5 seconds

## Testing the Integration

1. **Upload the code** to your ESP32
2. **Open Serial Monitor** (115200 baud)
3. **Check WiFi connection** - should show IP address
4. **Open web interface** at `http://localhost:3000/lighting`
5. **Test commands** from web interface
6. **Monitor serial output** for command execution
7. **Check sensor data** updates in web interface

## Expected Serial Output
